### Known Issues / Ease of use Issues 
* PokemonGo Functionality for IV Calculation is faked. 
* Search Functions are not properly optimized. 
* Exit Function is inefficient, due to the delete-and-export JSON style i've incorporated to hastily complete this "feature" for my school assignment. 
* Some menus do not have an exit or head back to previous function for ease of use.
